# If you prefer the indented syntax, you might want to regenerate this
# project again passing --syntax sass, or you can uncomment this:
# preferred_syntax = :sass
# and then run from within the 'statarkers' folder (and no deeper):
# sass-convert -R --from scss --to sass sass scss && rm -rf sass && mv scss sass
# sass lovers must then remember to comment out the line below:
preferred_syntax = :scss
